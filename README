== Local configuration ==

Emend will look for local configuration files in a "/config" directory.
These are optional and must be yaml formatted. They will automatically
be cached in memcached.

=== Twitter credentials ===

File: /config/twitter.yaml

This file should contain two keys, 'prod' and 'dev', which each should
contain 'username' and 'password' keys.

=== Bitly credentials ===

File: /config/bitly.yaml

This file should contain two keys, 'prod' and 'dev', which each should
contain 'login' and 'apiKey' keys.

=== Admin configuration ==

File: /config/admin.yaml

This file should contain a flat {key: value, ...} dictionary. Each item
corresponds to a link in the admin section of the footer. The key is the
inner HTML of each link and the value is the href.
